Here's a Python example demonstrating how to structure a basic database application using imports. The project will have multiple files that are imported into each other, which includes:

1. **`db_connect.py`**: Handles the database connection.
2. **`models.py`**: Contains the database models (tables).
3. **`controllers.py`**: Handles the business logic and routes.
4. **`app.py`**: Main application where everything is tied together.

### Project Structure:

```
my_project/
│
├── app.py            # Main application entry point
├── db_connect.py     # Database connection management
├── models.py         # Database models (tables)
├── controllers.py    # Controller (routes and business logic)
└── requirements.txt  # List of required dependencies (e.g., `Flask`, `SQLAlchemy`)
```

---

### 1. `db_connect.py` - Database Connection

This file handles the database connection.

```python
# db_connect.py

import sqlite3

def create_connection(db_file):
    """Create and return a database connection to the SQLite database."""
    conn = None
    try:
        conn = sqlite3.connect(db_file)
        print(f"Connection established to {db_file}")
    except sqlite3.Error as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
    return conn
```

### 2. `models.py` - Database Models

This file contains the data models (tables) for the database. Here we define a simple table called `users`.

```python
# models.py

from db_connect import create_connection

def create_table():
    """Create a table in the database if it doesn't exist."""
    conn = create_connection('my_database.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    # Create table if not exists
    cursor.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
                        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
                        name TEXT NOT NULL,
                        email TEXT NOT NULL)''')

    conn.commit()
    print("Table 'users' created successfully.")

def add_user(name, email):
    """Insert a new user into the database."""
    conn = create_connection('my_database.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES (?, ?)", (name, email))
    conn.commit()
    print(f"User {name} added successfully.")
```

### 3. `controllers.py` - Controllers (Routes)

This file is responsible for handling business logic and routes. In this example, we simulate adding a new user.

```python
# controllers.py

from models import add_user

def create_new_user(name, email):
    """Controller for creating a new user."""
    add_user(name, email)
    print(f"Controller: New user {name} with email {email} created.")
```

### 4. `app.py` - Main Application

This is the entry point of the application, where everything is tied together.

```python
# app.py

from models import create_table
from controllers import create_new_user

# Set up the database and create tables
create_table()

# Add a new user using the controller
create_new_user('Alice', 'alice@example.com')
create_new_user('Bob', 'bob@example.com')
```

### Explanation of Imports:

1. **`import sqlite3`**:
   - This is an import of the `sqlite3` module which is used to interact with SQLite databases.

2. **`from db_connect import create_connection`**:
   - In `models.py`, we import the `create_connection` function from `db_connect.py` to establish a connection to the database.
   
3. **`from models import create_table, add_user`**:
   - In `controllers.py`, we import the `add_user` function from `models.py` to interact with the database and add a new user.

4. **`from controllers import create_new_user`**:
   - In `app.py`, we import the `create_new_user` function from `controllers.py` to handle the logic of creating new users.

### How to Run:

1. **Install SQLite (Optional)**:
   - SQLite is part of Python’s standard library, so no installation is required unless you’re using a different database like MySQL or PostgreSQL.

2. **Run `app.py`**:
   - To run the app, simply run `python app.py` from your terminal.

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   This will create the database, create the users table (if it doesn't exist), and add new users.

### Example Output:

```bash
Connection established to my_database.db
Table 'users' created successfully.
Controller: New user Alice with email alice@example.com created.
Controller: New user Bob with email bob@example.com created.
```

### Why Use Imports?

- **Separation of Concerns**: By splitting the logic into separate files, the application is easier to maintain and extend. Each file has a distinct responsibility (database connection, models, routes).
- **Reusability**: Functions like `create_connection`, `create_table`, and `add_user` can be reused across different parts of the project.
- **Modular Structure**: With this structure, you can focus on small, manageable pieces of code, which makes debugging and scaling easier.

### Conclusion:

This project structure demonstrates how to organize a simple Python application with a database backend. The use of imports allows different modules (files) to interact with each other efficiently and keeps the project organized. You can easily extend this structure by adding more models, routes, and other application logic.
